As web security measures advance, reCAPTCHA v3 Enterprise has become one of the most sophisticated methods of distinguishing between bots and human users. Unlike reCAPTCHA v2, reCAPTCHA v3 operates invisibly and evaluates user interactions to assign a "bot-like" or "human-like" score. For developers working on web automation, solving reCAPTCHA v3 Enterprise can be challenging, especially when trying to obtain a high score that mimics human behavior. However, with the right tools such as Python and Selenium, this challenge becomes manageable.


In this article, We’ll guide you through setting up your environment, implementing code to solve the reCAPTCHA v3 challenge

## What is reCAPTCHA v3 Enterprise?

reCAPTCHA v3 Enterprise is a more advanced version of Google’s CAPTCHA system, designed to detect automated traffic without interrupting user experience. Unlike previous versions (e.g., reCAPTCHA v2), which require users to click on images or check a box, reCAPTCHA v3 operates invisibly in the background, using machine learning algorithms to assign a risk score to each user action.

Instead of presenting visual challenges to users, reCAPTCHA v3 assigns a score between 0 and 1, where scores closer to 0 represent bot-like activity, and scores closer to 1 indicate human behavior. Websites can use this score to determine whether to block or allow specific actions.


## Detecting reCAPTCHA v3 on a Webpage

Unlike reCAPTCHA v2, reCAPTCHA v3 operates invisibly and may not display any visible CAPTCHA challenges. However, the reCAPTCHA widget still exists in the background of the webpage. To detect it, inspect the webpage's HTML and look for elements that contain `g-recaptcha` or references to Google's CAPTCHA APIs.

Here’s how you can identify the presence of reCAPTCHA v3:

1. **Inspecting the Page**: Open the developer tools in your browser (right-click on the page and select “Inspect”). Look for the following in the HTML source:
   ```html
   <script src="https://www.google.com/recaptcha/api.js" async defer></script>
   ```

2. **Automating the Detection**: You can use Selenium to programmatically detect reCAPTCHA:
   ```python
   try:
       driver.find_element(By.XPATH, "//script[contains(@src, 'recaptcha/api.js')]")
       print("reCAPTCHA v3 detected")
   except:
       print("No reCAPTCHA detected")
   ```

### Prerequisites

Before you begin, ensure you have the following:

- **Proxy (Optional)**: A proxy can help distribute requests and mimic more realistic user behavior.
- **Python installed**: Ensure that Python is installed on your system. If not, download it from the [official Python website](https://www.python.org/downloads/).
- **CapSolver API key**: You'll need an API key, which can be obtained by signing up for an account on the [CapSolver dashboard](https://dashboard.capsolver.com/passport/login/?utm_source=official&utm_medium=blog&utm_campaign=recaptchav3enterprise).


###  Step 1: Install Necessary Packages

To begin solving reCAPTCHA v3 Enterprise, you need to install the CapSolver package. Use the following command to install it:

```bash
pip install capsolver
```

This package allows you to interface with the CapSolver API, which is specifically designed to handle various CAPTCHA challenges, including reCAPTCHA v3 Enterprise.



### Step 2: Python Code to Solve reCAPTCHA v3 Enterprise (With Proxy)

If you plan to use a proxy, here's a Python script that solves reCAPTCHA v3 Enterprise and aims to obtain a human-like score between 0.7 and 0.9:

```python
import capsolver
from urllib.parse import urlparse

# Change these values
PROXY = "http://username:password@ip:port"
capsolver.api_key = "YourApiKey"
PAGE_URL = ""
PAGE_KEY  = ""
PAGE_ACTION = ""

def solve_recaptcha_v3_enterprise(url, key, pageAction):
    solution = capsolver.solve({
        "type": "ReCaptchaV3EnterpriseTask",
        "websiteURL": url,
        "websiteKey": key,
        "pageAction": pageAction,
        "proxy": PROXY
    })
    return solution

def main():
    print("Solving reCAPTCHA v3 Enterprise...")
    solution = solve_recaptcha_v3_enterprise(PAGE_URL, PAGE_KEY, PAGE_ACTION)
    token = solution["gRecaptchaResponse"]
    print("Solution Token: ", token)

if __name__ == "__main__":
    main()
```

#### ⚠️ Important Variables

- **PROXY**: Make sure to replace this with your actual proxy details in the format `http://username:password@ip:port`. If you’re using a proxy, ensure it is reliable to avoid being flagged as suspicious.
- **capsolver.api_key**: Replace `"YourApiKey"` with your actual CapSolver API key. You can generate this by logging into your [CapSolver dashboard](https://dashboard.capsolver.com/passport/login/?utm_source=official&utm_medium=blog&utm_campaign=recaptchav3enterprise).
- **PAGE_URL**: Replace with the URL of the website containing reCAPTCHA v3 Enterprise.
- **PAGE_KEY**: This is the website's reCAPTCHA key, which you will need to extract from the page.
- **PAGE_ACTION**: The specific action being evaluated by reCAPTCHA. You can learn how to find this value from [this guide](https://www.capsolver.com/blog/All/how-to-identify-and-find-values-of-recaptchav3).


###  Step 3: Solving reCAPTCHA v3 Enterprise (Without Proxy)

For cases where you’re not using a proxy, the script is simpler. Here's how you can solve reCAPTCHA v3 Enterprise without a proxy:

```python
import capsolver
from urllib.parse import urlparse

# Change these values
capsolver.api_key = "YourApiKey"
PAGE_URL = ""
PAGE_KEY  = ""
PAGE_ACTION = ""

def solve_recaptcha_v3_enterprise(url, key, pageAction):
    solution = capsolver.solve({
        "type": "ReCaptchaV3EnterpriseTaskProxyless",
        "websiteURL": url,
        "websiteKey": key,
        "pageAction": pageAction
    })
    return solution

def main():
    print("Solving reCAPTCHA v3 Enterprise...")
    solution = solve_recaptcha_v3_enterprise(PAGE_URL, PAGE_KEY, PAGE_ACTION)
    token = solution["gRecaptchaResponse"]
    print("Solution Token: ", token)

if __name__ == "__main__":
    main()
```

## Best Practices for Solving reCAPTCHA v3 Enterprise

1. **Using Proxies**: If you're sending multiple requests from the same IP, consider using rotating proxies to minimize the risk of being flagged as a bot.

2. **Human-Like Interaction**: reCAPTCHA v3 assigns a score based on user behavior. To improve your chances of obtaining a human-like score, ensure that your automated interactions (clicks, scrolls, navigation) mimic real human activity. Introducing random delays between actions can make your automation seem more natural.

3. **Optimize for Score 0.7-0.9**: CapSolver is built to provide human-like scores between 0.7 and 0.9 when solving reCAPTCHA v3. For detailed insights on how to optimize your automation for such scores, check out this [CapSolver blog post](https://www.capsolver.com/blog/reCAPTCHA/how-to-solve-reCAPTCHA-v3).
